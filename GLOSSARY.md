# Contiguous
In the context of the arrays, it means continuous sequence of array elements. For example, given an array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]:
[1,2,3] is a contiguous subarray, while [1,2,5] is a non-contiguous subarray.

# Lexicographically Smaller
In mathematics, the lexicographic or lexicographical order (also known as lexical order, dictionary order, alphabetical order or lexicographic(al) product) is a generalization of the way the alphabetical order of words is based on the alphabetical order of their component letters.

# Spiral

Given positive integer $$n$$ as input, return a square matrix from 1 to $$n^2$$ in spiral order. See example for explanation

## Example

```
Input: 3
Ouput: 
[
    [1, 2, 3],
    [8, 9, 4],
    [7, 6, 5]
]
```

### Explanation

This question is similar to [Spiral (Example)](/arrays/primer/spiral_example.html), with only difference that now you need to generate the array. In this example, if you go through the matrix in clockwise spiral, you can traverse from 1 to $$n^2$$.

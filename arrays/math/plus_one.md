# Plus One

Given a number that is represented as an array of digits, add 1 to it, and return the new array.

## Example

```
Input  : [1,2,3]
Output : [1,2,4]
```

### Explanation
`[1,2,3]` corresponds to the number `123`. If 1 is added to it, the result would be `124`, which is returned as `[1,2,4]`.

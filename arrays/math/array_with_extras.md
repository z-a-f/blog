# Array with extras :)

You are given an array of `n` integers from `1` to `n`. Each integers appears exactly once except `A` which appears **twice** and `B` which is **missing**. Return `[A, B]`.

_**Implementation Note:**_ The algorithms must have linear time and constant space complexity

## Example

```
Input  : [3, 1, 2, 5, 3]
Output : [3, 4]
```

### Explanation
The array has 5 elements, so it should have all elements from 1 to 5. 3 is repeated twice, while 4 is never occurs there.

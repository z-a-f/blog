# Interval 1

Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval into the array. Merge if necessary.

**Assumption:** The intervals are initially sorted by the starting times.

Input format: `A`, `I`, where `A` is the original array, and `I` is the new interval

## Example

```
Input: [[1, 3], [6, 9]], [2, 5]
Output: [[1, 5], [6, 9]]
```

# Wave

Given and array of integers sort the array into a wave-like array.

In other words, rearrange the elements into a sequence such that $$a_1 \ge a_2 \le a_3 \ge a_4 \le a_5 \ldots$$

If multiple solutions are available, return lexicographically smaller.

## Example

```
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: [2, 1, 4, 3]
```

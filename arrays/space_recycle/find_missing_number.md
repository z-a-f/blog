# Find Missing Number

Given an unsorted integer array, find the first missing positive integer - that is if the array has 1, 2, and 3, the next positive integer is 4.

The runtime should be linear, and the space complexity should be constant

$$T = O(n), \\
S = O(1)$$

## Example 1
```
Input: [1, 2, 0]
Output: 3
```

## Example 2
```
Input: [3, 4, -1, 1]
Output: 2
```

## Example 3
```
Input: [-8, -7, -6]
Output: 1
```

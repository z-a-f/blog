# Decimal to Binary

Given an integer, convert it to binary and return the result as a string. If the number is negative, return the 2's complement.

### Example

```
Input: 6
Output: '110'

Input: -6

```

**Note:** for negative number, just return the minimum number of bits that would represent the 2's complement.

What is it?
=======

I will try to collect some interview questions in here. As of now most of the content is coming from [Interviewbit](https://www.interviewbit.com) - I strongly suggest checking it out. It has a lot of questions and an OJ (online judge), that you can use to assess your understanding of the material. I am planning on going into [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) after I am done with Interviewbit.
